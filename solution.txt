Please add your pseudocode to this file
Function consecutiveSubstrings(strings)
    Create an empty list(array) called result
    For each position i from 0 to length of string - 1
        Set current substring to empty string
        For each position j from i to length of string -1
            Add character at position j to current substring 
            Add current substring to result list 
        End For
    End For
    Return result
End Function

And a written explanation of your solution
- Create a list to store results
- Pick the starting line using loop 
- Make substrings from the starting letter
    - use a variable `current` to store the substring we are making
    - each time a new letter is added, push current into the result list
- Repeat for all starting letters
- Return all substrings
